# CodeClause_Exam_Seating_Arrangement_System
I've performed the Golden Project of my CodeClause Java Development Internship, which is an Exam Seating Arrangement System. It takes the classroom &amp; students' batch info. After that, it calculates the no. of students and create a seating arrangement for those student. Using file handling, the seating arrangement gets stored in a .txt file.

To run the program in VS Code, first download the Java VS Code Extension by Microsoft. And then run using F5, or navigating to the run button by selecting the program file. Thank you!
